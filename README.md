# [FriendlyTabs](http://friendlytabs.herokuapp.com/home) - Guitar Tablature Site

[FriendlyTabs](https://justtabs.http://friendlytabs.herokuapp.com/home.com/home) is a personal project that I build in a few days to test out some scrapping technologies. It uses Cheerio to scrap tablature data from websites and saves it in a mongoDB for my sites use. All Tablature on UltimateGuitar.com is free to use and distribute so it's 100% legal.

## Downloading for personal use

## Built With
